<h1>Economic Growth</h1>

<p>Land is generally considered one of the most important factors of production. Certain industries rely on land more than others. For instance, a real estate developer needs it to make good on its investments. But technology companies and those that rely on automation tend to rely less on land, making it a less significant factor of production.</p>

<p class="rel">Labor consists of the people who are responsible for the creation of goods and services (from beginning to end) and the effort they put forth. These individuals include factory workers, managers, salespeople, and engineers who design the machinery used in production. As such, it can take on many forms. For instance, the effort of construction workers who work on a building site and quality control workers who ensure products are ready to go to market make up this category.</p>

<p>Although most people think capital is cash, the term here actually describes a number of other assets. Capital goods are also considered capital, which includes manufacturing plants, machinery, tools, or any equipment used in the production process. Capital may also refer to a fleet of trucks or forklifts as well as heavy machinery.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship is the fourth factor and includes the visionaries and innovators behind the entire production process. The entrepreneurs combine all the other factors of production to conceptualize, create, and produce the product or service. They are the drivers behind any technical change in the economic system which has been shown to be a major source of economic growth.</p>
